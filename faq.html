            <h1><a name="BIRS">About BIRS</a></h1>
            <h2>What is BIRS?</h2>
            <p>
            The Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery (BIRS) is a joint Canada-US-Mexico initiative that seeks to bring together people from a wide range of mathematical, scientific and industry backgrounds and to create a forum for the exchange of knowledge and methods between these specialists.
            </p>
            <p> For information relating to the history, mandate, governance, and program descriptions of BIRS, feel free to explore our website at: http://www.birs.ca/about.</p>
            <p>Please note that while BIRS provides logistical support for the activities at CMO, is not responsible for any aspect of its local operations. Participants assume responsibility for their own travel and well being as is customary for conferences of this nature.
            </p>

            <h1><a name="CMO">About CMO</a></h1>
            <h2>What is CMO?</h2>

            <p>All of the designated hotels are located within a close vicinity to the workshop venue. If for any accessibility or other reason you are unable to walk (approximately 10 minutes) by foot and would need to stay at the closest hotel, please indicate this preference at least two weeks prior to the workshop start date (to cmo-birs2015@cimat.mx) and we will do our best to accommodate you.</p>
            <h2>For how long can I stay at the facility?</h2>
            <p>Participants in 5-day workshops can check into their hotel on Sunday and typically remain until the Friday of the same week.</p>
            <p>If you plan to arrive before Sunday or intend to remain in Oaxaca or Mexico beyond Friday, please note that you will be expected to book your own accommodation. The Hotel Hacienda Los Laureles and the Hotel Angel Inn will both offer a 30% discount to CMO participants, however, due to other workshops, this is subject to availability. Other accommodation may be found using Trip Advisor.</p>
            <h2>May I bring a guest?</h2>
            <p>Yes. However, please note that if you bring guests, they will have to pay for their own meals.

            <h2>Do I need to stay in CMO's accommodation?</h2>
            <p>Accommodation at the Hotel Hacienda Los Laureles is automatically granted to all workshop participants. If, however, you do not feel that such accommodation is right for you, a number of alternatives are available. CMO recommends using Trip Advisor to find alternatives.</p>

            <p>Each room has air conditioning/heating, towels, cotton bathrobes, hairdryer, soaps and shampoos, classic-style furnishings, 25 inch color television, wireless Internet in all areas and office center.</p>
            <h2>Is there a way for me to get my laundry done at the hotel?</h2>
            <p>Yes. Laundry services are available to all hotel guests.</p>
            <h2>If I have mobility issues, will I be able to navigate the CMO and hotel accommodation?</h2>
            <p>Please include your request in your registration, at least two weeks in advance, and confirm via email at cmo-birs2015@cimat.mx.</p>
            <h2>Is there a telephone line through which I can be reached during my stay with CMO?</h2>
            <p>Yes, there will be a telephone in each room. Once you have received your hotel assignment, you may have your calls directed either to Hotel Hacienda Los Laureles: +52 951 501-5300 or Hotel Angel Inn: +52 951 133-6128 or +52 951 133-6129.</p>
            -->
            <h1><a name="meal">Meals</a></h1>
            <h2>Where and how do I get my meals?</h2>
            <P>All meals will be served at the restaurant in Hotel Hacienda Los Laureles. CMO participants will receive a scheduled breakfast, lunch and dinner, for which the menu will be fixed (ie. you will not have a choice of options). If you have any dietary restrictions, please include your request in your online registration or via email at cmo-birs2015@cimat.mx, at least two weeks in advance. </P>
            <h1>What are the meal costs for guests?</h1>
            <p>If your guest wishes to join you for meals he/she will be not be able to receive the fixed participant meal, however, may order off the regular hotel menu with a special discount of 20%.</p>
            
            <h1>Computers</h1>
            <h2>Are there any computers available for use at the hotels?</h2>

            <!--
            <h1>Information for Organizers</h1>
            <h2>If I want to organize a workshop at CMO, what should I do?</h2>
            <p>All potential organizers must submit an application and proposal to the BIRS Scientific Advisory Board. Information on this process is found on the BIRS website, as well as updated calls for proposals and deadlines. Please consult our “For Applicants” section at: http://www.birs.ca/applicants/guidelines</p>
            <h2>What is the “organizer interface”?</h2>
            <p>The organizer interface is an online program that allows all organizers to manage the various events that they are planning. Through the interface, organizers can access lists of invitees, see breakdowns of who is attending workshops (or not) etc. </p>
            <p>It is very important that organizers check their interface accounts regularly, particularly in the early stages of the invitation process, as invitations cannot be sent out to potential participants until all of the invitees’ relevant information (names, email addresses and so on) has been entered into the interface by the organizer him/herself and the draft list of invitees has been confirmed by him/her. Please always send the BIRS program coordinator (birs@birs.ca) a note when new invitee information has been entered into the interface so that we know when and how to proceed.</p>
            <h2>How do I create an account on the organizer interface?</h2>
            <p>Go to https://www.birs.ca/orgs and click on “Create Account”. Set up a username and password, which you can use to log into the interface every subsequent time. Be sure to use the same email address in logging into the interface as you used in registering for the workshop. This will allow the system to identify you as an organizer.</p>
            <h2>How do I send out invitations to participants?</h2>
            <p>Organizers are tasked with making initial invitee lists and entering all potential invitee information (names, email addresses etc) into the organizer interface. All invitees must be initially classified as either “participants” (maximum 42 in most cases, but check the event details beforehand, because sometimes the maximum number of participants allowed is smaller) or as “back-up participants”. When this has been completed, send the BIRS program coordinator (birs@birs.ca) a quick note. We will send you back a confirmation before we send out official invitations from our central database. Through your interface account you can track the number of people who accept or decline invitations. After a time, we may prompt you to choose some of the people from your “back-up participants” list to become formal, invited potential participants. We will then send out a second round of invitations on your behalf.</p>

            <p>Please visit this link for information on planning your 5-day CMO-BIRS Workshop.<p>
            <h2>After Your 5-day CMO-BIRS Workshop</h2>
            <p>Please visit this link for information on processes to complete after your 5-day CMO-BIRS Workshop.</p>
            <h1>Workshop Information</h1>
            <h2>I would like to participate in a workshop. Can I register somewhere?</h2>
            <p>Workshop participation is by invitation only. Individual workshop organizers are responsible for drafting lists of potential invitees, not CMO or BIRS directly; however, if you are interested in participating in a particular workshop you can email a BIRS administrator, who will forward your statement of interest to one of the organizers involved. If you are a student we recommend sending a letter of recommendation from your supervisor along with your initial email.<p>
            <h2>Could BIRS send me my invitations and information packages by regular post?</h2>
            <p>BIRS is unfortunately unable to do this, for a number of reasons, particularly due to the sheer volume of information that we require from all participants, compatibility with our online database, and the occasional need for very prompt replies. If a participant is unable to be reached by email on a regular basis, he/she should contact his/her workshop contact organizer to make alternate arrangements.<p>
            <h2>How do I change my registration details?</h2>
            <p>You can email the BIRS Program Coordinator at: birs@birs.ca.<p>
            <h2>I have been invited to attend a workshop, but I won’t know if I will be able to commit to it until after the RSVP deadline. What should I do?</h2>
            <p>It is important for BIRS administrators to know who is attending any given workshop well in advance of the workshop itself. This allows us not only to think about room allocation and meal plans, but also to potentially invite more people to join the workshop, if definite places remain. As such, we would ask that you respond to all of our emails as promptly as possible; however, we understand that it can be difficult for some people to commit to certain workshops so early on, especially if traveling from abroad. We would ask that if you are unable to give us a definite answer before the deadline, you write to us to tell us so, stating your reason for delay and when you are likely to know by. This will greatly facilitate our planning! We will forward your email to the appropriate organizers.</p>
            <h2>I was contacted by BIRS a while ago, but haven’t received any invitations or updates since then. Why is that?</h2>
            <p>If you think you haven’t received information from BIRS that you ought to have, we recommend first checking your spam folder. Should that fail, please contact us for any missing information at: birs@birs.ca.<p>
            <h2>Can I see the detailed schedule and abstracts for my workshop in advance?</h2>

BIRS administrators post detailed schedules and abstracts for workshops to the website as soon as they are made available to us. These can be found by going to http://www.birs.ca/location/cmo/2015/all. Select the year of the event you will be attending in the scroll-down menu at the top of the page. By clicking on the code next to the title (ex: 15w5167) you will be brought to the workshop-specific homepage. There you will find any schedules or abstracts that have been posted. 

If you wish to see a program before it is finalized and published online, contact your workshop organizers and they may be able to give you details.

As a presenter, will I be able to publish workshop lecture slides to the web?

Yes. The following instructions explain how to publish files related to your workshop on the workshop web page: http://www.birs.ca/organizers/publishing-slides.

I need to write a workshop report. Are there any guidelines or templates available?

You can find old workshop reports online at: http://www.birs.ca/reports. 

Bear in mind that your audience is scientists.

Testimonials

What is the purpose of the testimonials that participants and organizers are asked to volunteer to write after workshops?

The benefits of testimonials are three-fold.

For participants, they provide an opportunity to think back on the past few days and to recall and organize one’s thoughts on what was learned throughout their time at CMO. 

For the workshop community at large, they enable people to see what stood out to their colleagues in each workshop; their colleagues may perhaps emphasize important aspects of the week they hadn’t before considered to be of note.

For BIRS and CMO, feedback helps us to see our strengths and our weaknesses. Positive testimonials also enable us to show our sponsors that the funds they have granted us are being put to good use. Testimonials are invaluable to us in the funding renewal process and participants’ taking the time to write one is thus very much appreciated!

How do I write a testimonial?

You may be contacted directly by email by our Scientific Director, requesting you to give us your input. If so, a link should be included in the email and you need only follow the steps as they appear.

If this is not the case, you can access a simple testimonial-writing page via our website at http://www.birs.ca/feedback.

What sorts of remarks should I make in a testimonial?

The content of a testimonial is largely up to you. Some people choose to write long paragraphs, while other people simply jot down a sentence or two. You can reflect upon the organization of the workshop, the setting and facilities in Oaxaca, the mathematical and scientific aspects of your specific workshop, or whatever else you deem to be appropriate. There are some guidelines on what to include as potential “scientific content” on our online testimonial-writing page at: http://www.birs.ca/feedback. 

You can see examples of testimonials by following the link on the BIRS homepage, where we publish excerpts of testimonials for the various workshops held in our facilities. http://www.birs.ca/testimonials. 

We endeavor to preserve the integrity of each testimonial, although we reserve the right to occasionally edit for grammar, clarity or anonymity, where appropriate.

Town of Oaxaca Information

What are the climate conditions in Oaxaca ?

Over the course of a year, the temperature in Oaxaca typically varies from 9°C to 31°C and is rarely below 6°C or above 34°C. Good sources for this information are https://weatherspark.com/averages/32580/Oaxaca-Mexico and http://espanol.weather.com/weather/today/Oaxaca+OA+M%C3%A9xico+MXOA0069:1:MX.

What are some good places to visit in Oaxaca and surroundings?

There are several amazing places to visit in Oaxaca. You can find information at http://oaxacatours.mx and request information at info @oaxacaexperts.com. 
What are the electrical systems and plug types used in Oaxaca ?

Mexico uses 127 V, 60 Hz electrical outlets, the same as those found in the U.S. and Canada.

Where can I exchange currencies?

It is highly advised to exchange currencies in your country of origin; your personal bank will provide you with the most accurate exchange rate, often without charging a commission fee. Airport currency exchanges are not advised, as they can charge exorbitant commission fees. There are several currency exchanges in downtown Oaxaca, and a bus from the hotels to downtown that takes about 15 minutes. Please note that many businesses in Oaxaca may not accept any currency other than cash; therefore, it is highly advisable that you obtain some local currency to use.

What is the etiquette around tipping?

Please be advised that gratuities for hotel staff have not been included as part of your participation in the CMO workshop. Hotel staff earn a low wage and are very grateful for your recognition of their hard work. A suggestion of at least /$15 USD for hotel staff is encouraged at the end of your stay.

For information on tipping guidelines in and around Oaxaca city, please visit Trip Advisor.
